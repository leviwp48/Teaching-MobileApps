===============

I would have to say that the best part about this assignment was that we really got the chance to connect our apps to a bigger system and create something with real applications. I thought PA2 was the real deal with the image effects and the use of the camera, but the possibilities that open from using outside software are infinite.
</br>
</br>
 I really wish that I knew more about how everything connects and programming for android in general, so that I could have made something that I was truly proud of. If had more time and a better grasp on what I was doing I would have gone through with making a drawing app for the google api. Not only would that be something useful for me to struggle in making but it would have been a great moment to show an app like that to a friend and really soak in the accomplishment. 
 </br>
 </br>
This assignment in its purest and simplest form was not the most difficult task to complete. However, I took it upon myself to try to expand on that and take the chance to learn a few things about programming for Android. For example, I decided to try using another activity to facilitate my app, instead of using one activity with two layouts. That was a tough hill to climb in simply understand what was, used for, and how to use it. The second thing I tried was making a class to help with my bitmaps and other data. Even though I already understand classes well in terms of C++, I had a few struggles getting around using them in C#. 
</br>
</br>
Something I’m excited to learn more of are properties. I had help from you when I was trying to figure out how to make my first one. I think it it’s a cool and useful tool. It’s something I wish I knew of before, especially if it is in C++ because I’ve had a lot of times when I could check when something had changed or had an effect happen to it. 
</br>
For the most part I finished what I was attempting to do, so overall, I’m happy with what the final product was. However, I wish I was able to try the app on an actual phone so that I could try categories that wouldn’t work within the emulator, which was a very limited amount. Also, I wanted to have the final screen include a prompt and another camera button, in which the user would take a picture of themselves or of someone else, and the google api would output its lowest confidence guess. Hopefully resulting in a pretty comical ending. 
</br>

I would say that for future students, for them to better prepare for this assignment that they should practice with activities within their PA1 and PA2. I think that that’s a key part of programming for android. It’s the control for everything that happens within the apps themselves.
