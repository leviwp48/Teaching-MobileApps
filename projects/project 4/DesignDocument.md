--- The name is mistakingly named Chess, but it is a game of Checkers. ---

My Project:
===========
This is a game of checkers created within Unity. This isn't fully functional, but successfully lays out the board and pieces of the game. 
Unfortunately I was unable to export the project over to Android because it wasn't fully functonal and had some compiling erros. I will 
have screen shots below to show what my program did. 

Purpose:
========
The purpose of creating this project was to dive into Unity before I had to work on the final project. This way I could have some 
knowledge and background to call from.

What I learned: 
===============
I started with the unity tutorial "2D Roguelike Tutorial". This helped me understand the workflow and gave me an idea of how all the pieces
come together. I learned how to create objects, how to write script for those objects, how to manipulate objects, how to have those objects
interact with other, and I learned how to work within a 2D game environment. One of the most important pieces, I believe, that I learned 
was how to use Ray's to detect other object's colliders so that they can interect with each other. A mistake I made was diverging from the 
tutorials and trying to put what I learned to the test too early. Because of this I think I may have missed some important developing 
standards. 

How to use:
===========
1. Open up the project within Unity. 
2. Hitting play will build the board and set the pieces
3. Clicking a piece will (hopefully) highlight the piece and display the possible moves. 
4. Clicking somewhere else will delete the displayed moves and return to the original state.
